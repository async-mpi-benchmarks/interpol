# Interpol traces concatenation

***Note:*** This script is now useless as the `interpol-rs` library automatically sorts and aggregates the traces outputed by each rank.

This helper script is designed to concatenate the Interpol traces generated by each process of a MPI application into a single JSON file. 
It is meant to use jointly with the Interpol Trace Analyzer GUI in order to gather the information of every MPI call performed by the profiled program.

## Usage
Simply run this script from where the `rank*_traces.json` files have been outputed:
```bash
bash interpol_concat.sh [output.json]
```
